## Setup

### Prep Work

1. You need to create your own application on Spotify to manage integrations: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login
1. Edit settings for your app on Spotify dev dashboard, specifically, add a dummy `redirect_uri`. For my integration I've used `http://localhost/` you can use any other uri as per your choice.

> note: if you use a different uri, then please make sure you update this line with yours https://github.com/chakrakan/spotify-box/blob/9e433bcd627d02962821d9d3e36b82e53d34a4b3/index.js#L35

1. Take note of your Spotify app's `client id` and `client secret`
1. Create a new public GitHub Gist (https://gist.github.com/)
1. Create a token with the `gist` scope and copy it. (https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
1. Generate an authentication code for your spotify account for using your newly created application by constructing this URL using your apps `client id` and your set `redirect uri` (make sure it's [url encoded](https://www.urlencoder.org/)) as values for the respective query params:

`https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=<YOUR-CLIENT-ID-HERE>&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2F&scope=user-top-read%20user-read-recently-played`

1. Copy the generated code after the `code` query from the resulting response url query result which should look like this: `http://localhost/?code=<COPY-EVERYTHING-HERE>`

### Project Setup

1. Fork this repo
1. Log into CircleCI with your GitHub (https://circleci.com/vcs-authorize/)
1. Click on "Add Projects" on the sidebar
1. Set up a project with the newly created fork
1. Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
1. Add the following environment variables:

- GIST_ID: The ID portion from your gist url https://gist.github.com/<github username>/6d5f84419863089a167387da62dd7081.
- GITHUB_TOKEN: The GitHub token generated above.
- SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID: Your Spotify application client id
- SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET: Your Spotify application client secret
- SPOTIFY_CODE: The code generated for you when you visited the constructed URL above in the last step of the prep work section
