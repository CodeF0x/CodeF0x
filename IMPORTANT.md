This is based on <a href="https://github.com/chakrakan/spotify-box">spotify-box</a>, a script that puts your most recent Spotify listening activity in a gist that you can pin on your GitHub profile.

I modified it (in a still dirty way) to display my recently most listened song, my overall most listened genre and my recently most listened genre. Feel free to fork my version and modify it further / use it for yourself. For a guide on how to use it, <a href="https://github.com/chakrakan/spotify-box/README.md">look here</a>.
