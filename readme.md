  Currently, I can't get enough of the song <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6dKC7vDWrm1TU8Wq0qeYLD">STFU</a> by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7lAi1Cv19DsukgGjbZQxFg">Annisokay</a> on Spotify.

  My most listened genre is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=dark wave music">dark wave</a>.
  Still, I've been listening to a lot of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=gothic metal music">gothic metal</a> lately.
